# 2D/3D Navigation


##Description

This example demonstrates coordinating navigation across 2D and 3D views in Autodesk Large Model Viewer (LMV). After loading the example application, click on any region of the building in the 2D view to navigate. Grab and move the red arrow to smoothly navigate across the building. If you are exploring the model in a main 3D view, the secondary 2D view will indicate your current position in the model.
